"Each player is handed 9 cards. 6 are placed on the table 3 of them side up.
These cards can only be played once the other 34 cards in the deck are exhausted.
 The other 3 are the hand of each player. Players must play a card,
which must be  higher than the previous play, otherwise they must pick up the
discard pile. The cards 2, 7, 10 are wildcards that can reset values, reverse
the play and bomb the discard pile respectively.
Players must pick up a card from the deck once they play a card down.
Whoever finishes the game with no cards left to play wins"
